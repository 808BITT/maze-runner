### Game Development Style Guide for Maze Runner

#### Codebase Guidelines

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Break down features into small, reusable modules.
   - Each module should have a single responsibility (e.g., maze generation, fog of war, player movement).
   - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.

2. **Code Documentation**:
   - Document all public methods and classes with clear comments.
   - Use inline comments for complex logic or algorithms (e.g., maze generation).
   - Maintain a `README.md` for each module explaining its purpose and usage.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages.
   - Follow a branching strategy (e.g., `main` for production, `dev` for development, feature branches for new features).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling for all server and client components.
   - Log errors with sufficient context for debugging.

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize algorithms for maze generation and fog of war calculations.
   - Profile and test performance for large mazes and multiplayer scenarios.

#### Unit Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Write unit tests for all core game mechanics (e.g., maze generation, fog of war, economy system).
   - Ensure at least 80% test coverage for critical modules.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Validate procedural maze generation for different difficulty levels.
   - Test fog of war mechanics for edge cases (e.g., player at maze boundaries).
   - Verify economy system calculations for various completion scenarios.

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Use a testing framework (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, Pytest for Python).
   - Automate test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between modules (e.g., player movement and fog of war).
   - Simulate game scenarios to ensure seamless gameplay.

#### Development Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Single Player Experience** (3-4 months)
   - Implement basic maze generation and player movement.
   - Develop fog of war mechanics and minimap functionality.
   - Create a single-player game loop and economy system foundation.
   - Write unit tests for all implemented features.

2. **Phase 2: Enhancement and Polish** (2-3 months)
   - Add advanced maze algorithms and character upgrades.
   - Improve UI/UX with visual and sound effects.
   - Introduce additional single-player challenges.
   - Conduct performance testing and optimization.

3. **Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation** (4-5 months)
   - Design server architecture for multiplayer.
   - Implement basic multiplayer functionality and account system.
   - Test server-client communication and scalability.

4. **Phase 4: Extended Game Modes** (4-6 months)
   - Develop Battle Royale and Tactical Team modes.
   - Add social features and advanced multiplayer mechanics.
   - Conduct extensive playtesting and bug fixing.

5. **Ongoing Maintenance**:
   - Regularly update the game with new content (e.g., mazes, skins).
   - Monitor player feedback and address issues promptly.
   - Optimize for new platforms (e.g., mobile).

This style guide and development plan will ensure a structured and efficient approach to building Maze Runner while maintaining high-quality standards.
